I am a data professional. I have extensive background working with varied data sets and using advanced analytics to enable business stakeholders to make informed decisions.

I'm committed to a never ending improvement and to this end, I recently expanded my skill set to include topics like Quarto, tidymodels, working in cross-language R/Python environment. I make time for freelance projects that are engaging and challenging!
